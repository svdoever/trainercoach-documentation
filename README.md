### Trainer-Coach

Welcome to the Trainer-Coach app, a unique app that will coach you, the trainer, on the training programme you are providing to your trainees. You can convert your training programs into an in-app step-by-step guide with timings to coach you in giving training. In the current modern times you will never leave home without your smartphone. This way you will always have your training material with you!

Training material is written in text files that need to be placed at an accessible location on the internet. The text files must be written in such a way that the app understands what exactly to display. The required formatting is described in this documentation.

### The way we write training programs

One way to write training programs that are accessible on the internet is with [GitHub](http://github.com), a code repository where you can write online in a web browser. Create an account on GitHub, then create a new repository:

In this repository create an index page named **index.md** that is the entry point to your training programs.

After the repository is created you will see:

Now create the training page and write the content:

When the training page is created you will see a readable version of the training text:

<img width="909" alt="training page created" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/246842/9836246/f3780898-5a11-11e5-98a0-ff8908dfe703.png">

### The url required for the app

In the app you can add a new exercises collection. An exercises collection is the combination of the index page and its linked training programmes. When you have created a repository on GitHub with an index page named **index.md**, the url to use to access the repository is:

`https://raw.githack.com/wiki/**yourname**/**yourrepository**/index.md`
